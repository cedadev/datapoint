<h1>Inspiration for DataPoint<a class="headerlink" href="#inspiration-for-datapoint" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>A paradigm shift is underway among many data storage centers as the need for cloud-accessible analysis-ready data increases.
There are significant issues relating to accessibility with current storage formats, and the existing archives of data which are
not suited for aggregation and usage in cloud applications. Several technologies are in development for storing data in more
cloud-accessible formats such as Zarr and Cloud-Optimised Geotiff (COG), as well as less storage-intensive reference formats
like Kerchunk and CFA. At CEDA we have begun to create and ingest these new file formats, but have yet to advertise these new
advancements to our user community. In order to create the best environment for accessing our cloud data products, we have
created an API called DataPoint.</p>
<section id="data-aggregations">
<h2>1. Data Aggregations<a class="headerlink" href="#data-aggregations" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The ideal scenario for accessing data from a user perspective is a single dataset object that contains all the data and attributes required.
In practice, a single file representing this dataset only works if the data is relatively small - very unlikely to be the case, especially
with increasing resolutions in new datasets. Instead the dataset is normally split up between multiple files that may represent a slice of the
total dataset in time, by region, or otherwise. This then presents a problem: how to present this to the user as a single continuous entity while pulling
from all the individual distributed files.</p>
<img alt="Data aggregated to an 'Atomic Dataset' - single object independent of chunks or files." src="_images/DataAggs.png" />
<p>Methods to solve this problem typically involve aggregating the data to present a unified dataset. This can be done either on-the-fly as the data is accessed,
or determined beforehand and saved somehow. This is where cloud optimised formats come in - saving the aggregations is far better because the
way to build the dataset is already known. On-the-fly aggregations may work well for small datasets, but if there are many thousands of files, each with
multiple variables and dimensions that need to be connected in a convoluted way, that will take some time!</p>
</section>
<section id="generating-cloud-formats">
<h2>2. Generating Cloud Formats<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-cloud-formats" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Over the last 18-24 months we’ve been using various tools to generate new reference files with Kerchunk or new cloud data
stores with Zarr. These have been ingested into the CEDA Archive and are accessible to all users - except that no one knows
how to use or even find them. Since these technologies are relatively new to most of the communities that make use of our services,
the mechanisms for accessing these types of data are not well known or well understood, with researchers using our data preferring
more well-established formats like NetCDF/HDF which have existed for several decades. What we were looking for was a way to
introduce these formats in a way that does not require all users to learn to use multiple new formats and tools in what would be a
large barrier to optimised use of our data.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-ceda-singularity">
<h2>3. The CEDA Singularity<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ceda-singularity" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>DataPoint is the culmination of several ideas around creating a single point of access to the data archived at CEDA; the so-called
‘CEDA Singularity’. It is a STAC API which connects to our STAC catalogs - again a new technology that most users do not utilise
- and can be used to search across our data holdings to find specific datasets and metadata. What sets DataPoint apart is the
ability to directly open datasets from cloud formats without the user needing to understand the format or specific configuration
for opening the dataset.</p>
<img alt="Diagram showing the connection from the CEDA Archive of NetCDF data up to an application layer via the STAC Catalog and Kerchunk reference files." src="_images/CEDASingularity.png" />
<p>All the storage details and options are abstracted from the users, for which it doesn’t matter anyway.
With DataPoint, a user can search across a vast library of datasets, select a specific dataset matching a set of constraints
and then simply open the result as a dataset. DataPoint handles the extraction of the link to the cloud formats stored in our
archive to present a dataset that looks the same regardless of what type or format the data is stored.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-s-next">
<h2>4. What’s Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-next" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Currently our STAC catalogs represent only a small fraction of the total CEDA archive which spans more than 40 years of data,
totalling over 25 Petabytes. Even less of the data has a cloud representation that can be fully utilised by datapoint.
The next step towards greater data accessibility will be to dramatically expand our STAC representations as well as the
cloud formats required for DataPoint. We have well established pipelines for generating both, which will become immediately
available to all DataPoint users when published to our production indexes. The below diagram illustrates these three components
delivering a cohesive data search service.</p>
